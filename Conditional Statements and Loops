PHP Conditional Statements

=> if statement --> Executes if some code is correct
=> if...else statement    --> Executes if some is correct and another code if the condition false
=> if.......elseif......else statement -->  Executes different codes for more than two conditions
=> switch statement -->  selects one of many blocks of code to be executed


Example :- Output "Have a good day!" if the current time (HOUR) is less than 20

<?php
$t = date("H");

if ($t < "20") {
  echo "Have a good day!";
}
?>



Switch Syntax 

switch (n) {
  case label1:
    code to be executed if n=label1;
    break;
  case label2:
    code to be executed if n=label2;
    break;
  case label3:
    code to be executed if n=label3;
    break;
    ...
  default:
    code to be executed if n is different from all labels;
}


Example:-

<?php
$favcolor = "red";

switch ($favcolor) {
  case "red":
    echo "Your favorite color is red!";
    break;
  case "blue":
    echo "Your favorite color is blue!";
    break;
  case "green":
    echo "Your favorite color is green!";
    break;
  default:
    echo "Your favorite color is neither red, blue, nor green!";
}
?>



PHP Loops

Loops are used to executed some part of code again and again 

While => loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
Do...while =>  loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
for => loops through a block of code a specified number of times
foreach => loops through a block of code for each element in an array

While Loop

Syntax

while (condition is true) {
  code to be executed;
}

Example: - The example below displays the numbers from 1 to 5:

<?php
$x = 1;

while($x <= 5) {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x++;
}
?>

Do....While Loop

syntax

do {
  code to be executed;
} while (condition is true);


Example:-

<?php
$x = 1;

do {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x++;
} while ($x <= 5);
?>

For Loop

syntax

for (init counter; test counter; increment counter) {
  code to be executed for each iteration;
}

Example:-
<?php
for ($x = 0; $x <= 10; $x++) {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
}
?>

Foreach Loop

syntax

foreach ($array as $value) {
  code to be executed;
}

Example:-
<?php
$colors = array("red", "green", "blue", "yellow");

foreach ($colors as $value) {
  echo "$value <br>";
}
?>

Break and Continue

The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop.

Example:-

<?php
for ($x = 0; $x < 10; $x++) {
  if ($x == 4) {
    break;
  }
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
}
?>

The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

Example:-

<?php
for ($x = 0; $x < 10; $x++) {
  if ($x == 4) {
    continue;
  }
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
}
?>
