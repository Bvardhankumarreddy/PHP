Constants are like variables except that once they are defined they cannot be changed or undefined.

A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. The value cannot be changed during the script.
A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore (no $ sign before the constant name).

Note:- Unlike variables, constants are automatically global across the entire script.

To creare PHP constant we need to use the define() function.

syntax define(name, value, case-insensitive).

Parameters

=> name: Specifies the name of the constant
=> value: Specifies the value of the constant
=> case-insensitive: Specifies whether the constant name should be case-insensitive. Default is false

Example:-

<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!");
echo GREETING;
?>

Output:-

Welcome to W3Schools.com!

Eample:-

<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!", true);
echo greeting;
?>

Output:-

Welcome to W3Schools.com!
