PHP Form Handling

The PHP superglobals $_GET and $_POST are used collect form-data

Example: - Simple HTML form using POST method.

<html>
<body>

<form action="welcome.php" method="post">
Name: <input type="text" name="name"><br>
E-mail: <input type="text" name="email"><br>
<input type="submit">
</form>

</body>
</html>

Exaplanation: -

When user fills the name and email data and clicks the submit button, the form data is sent to the "welcome.php". The form data is sent
with HTTP POST method.

Example: - Simple HTML form using GET method.

<html>
<body>

<form action="welcome_get.php" method="get">
Name: <input type="text" name="name"><br>
E-mail: <input type="text" name="email"><br>
<input type="submit">
</form>

</body>
</html>

Explanation: - The same result is achieved after using this form.

GET vs POST

Both GET and POST create an array (e.g. array( key1 => value1, key2 => value2, key3 => value3, ...)). This array holds key/value pairs,
where keys are the names of the form controls and values are the input data from user.

Both GET and POST are treated as $_GET and $_POST. These superglobals, which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope -
and you can access then from any function, class or file without having do to anything special.

$_GET is an array of variables passed to the current script via URL parameters.

$_POST is an array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method.
